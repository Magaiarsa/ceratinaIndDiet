# Overview 
We examine the occurrence of individual specialization in a solitary bee species, *Ceratina australensis* in three different wild populations from Australia. We use data previously published by @mcfrederick2019wild on metabarcoding of the pollen contents of *Ceratina* nests to characterize the plant, bacteria, and fungi present in each individual nest. We show that bee individuals have marked dietary specialization and that the level of specialization varies across populations. In the most specialized population, we also show that individuals' diet breadth was positively related to the richness of fungi, but not bacteria. Overall, individual specialization appeared to have a weak or negligible effect on the microbial richness of nests, suggesting that different mechanisms beyond environmental transmission may be at play regarding microbial acquisition in wild bees.
