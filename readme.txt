# Overview 
We examine the occurrence of individual specialization in a solitary bee species, *Ceratina australensis* in three different wild populations from Australia. We use data previously published by McFrederick & Rehan (2019; Microbial Ecology 77: 513–22) on metabarcoding of the pollen contents of *Ceratina* nests to characterize the plant, bacteria, and fungi present in each individual nest. We show that bee individuals have marked dietary specialization and that the level of specialization varies across populations. In the most specialized population, we also show that individuals' diet breadth was positively related to the richness of fungi, but not bacteria. Overall, individual specialization appeared to have a weak or negligible effect on the microbial richness of nests, suggesting that different mechanisms beyond environmental transmission may be at play regarding microbial acquisition in wild bees.

This repo contains a pdf describing the data and analyses, as well as excel file with the raw data (`rawData.xlsx`), a csv file with the metadata (`metadata.csv`), and RScript with the analyses to statistical results and figures (`analyses.R`). 

# Data and Metadata
In the excel file  spreadsheets, across all spreadsheets each line represents a genus/ASV and the columns have information related to the metabarcoding (sequence ID, best taxonomic match, etc), as well as the number of reads found in each brood cell of each individual nest. There are four spreadsheets in total: `plant` (with the genus-level plant data), `plant_asv` (with the ASV plant data---see Online Supplement for details), `bact` (with the ASV bacteria data), and `fungi` (with the ASV fungi data). 

From the raw data, as described in the methods in the main text, we created matrices of nests (individuals) x taxonomic group for plants, plants ASV, bacteria, and fungi. We then used the plant matrix to calculate proportional similarity index for each individual using the `PSicalc` function in the `RInSp` package. As a measure of resource overlap among individuals, we calculated `weighted.closeness` that individual in their plant network from the plant matrix, using the `weighted.closeness` function in the `bipartite` package. All analyses were done in R version 4.0.2. 

In the file `metadata.csv` each line represents one individual/nest (`inds`) from each of the three different populations (`pop`). The column `degree` refers to the total number of plant genera present in the nest (richness), `weighted.closeness` is the closeness centrality, `psis` is the proportional similarity index. The next six columns are the rarefied richness of bacteria and fungi associated to the pollen, in three different rarefaction depths (see Methods and Online Supplement for details).  


These files are also available on Dryad () and Zenodo (doi: 10.5281/zenodo.6327241), and previously published sequence data are publicly available under NCBI/EMBL/DDBJ accession numbers SAMN08911168- SAMN08911424.
